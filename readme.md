These are my [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/) scripts.

Most of the useful stuff lives in `space.ahk`.

`qwertmak.ahk` contains shortcuts for using a [Colemak](http://colemak.com/) keyboard to output QWERTY keys, which is sometimes useful for video games.

`space-surface.ahk` contains shortcuts to use my Surface Pro 4 more like my Pok3r (which has another layer under the Fn key, which replaces caps lock), for the sake of muscle memory.

`space.ahk` contains multiple things:

* Emoji text expansion, e.g. from `;ok;` to `üëå`.
* Right-alt shortcuts for the input of a variety of symbols such as `¬∞`, `‚âà`, `√ó`, and `‚Äù`.
* Also a few diacritics and arrows.
* A few miscellaneous shortcuts for things like toggling caps lock with Win+Shift and media shortcuts.
